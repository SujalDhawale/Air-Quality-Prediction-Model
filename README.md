# Air-Quality-Prediction-Model
his repository contains a Machine Learning-based Air Quality Prediction Model developed as part of my internship at Edunet. The model predicts air pollution levels using various environmental factors such as PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, SO2, and O3.

📌 Project Overview
🔹 Objective: Predict AQI based on historical and real-time air pollution data.
🔹 Technologies Used: 🐍 Python, 📊 Pandas, 📈 Matplotlib, 🤖 Scikit-Learn.
🔹 Dataset: Publicly available AQI datasets from Kaggle.

🚀 Features
✅ Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and normalization.
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing pollution trends and correlations.
✅ Machine Learning Models: Training and comparing multiple regression models.
✅ Prediction & Forecasting: Estimating AQI based on given environmental parameters.
